TODO ObjectManager
==================


- Fix manager window title

- Fix lock error logged in the console



Missing Features
----------------

- Pick and drop to move objects around

	- Link (default)
	- Copy (option key)
	- Move (command + option key or perhaps just command key)

- Deleted objects smart group and Object Undeletion

- Time-based smart groups (in When section of the source list)

- Import/Export. ObjectManager should support just few basic types at least initially:

	- Bookmark
	- Image
	- ?

- Support opening multiple manager windows

- Note Management 

	- Note Library
	
	- Notes can include Lists e.g. Todo or Buy lists.

	- Simple Note View (actived if the Notes library is selected)
	
		- Something similar to Google Keep but a bit smarter and with a better usability

		- Would provide a very basic Outliner to edit lists
		
	- Notes can be opened in a real Outliner (notes are just normal outliner documents) or a Structured Text Editor
	
	- Full-blown Outliner documents can be browsed in the ObjectManager (using the Note View or the List  view)


Future Work
-----------

- Library Management (creation, deletion, export and import)

- Temporal Search against the store 
	
	- For now we just support searching the latest object revisions in memory

- Device Representations e.g. external hard disks

- Filesystem Browsing (as an advanced option) using COFile and CODirectory
