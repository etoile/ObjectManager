TODO ObjectManager
==================


ObjectManager is loosely based on some mockups and ideas:

Current Work
------------

- Fix manager window title

- Fix lock error logged in the console

- Fix tag collection editor in Inspector

- Fix missing commits for object editing from the Inspector

- Fix Inspector appearing very briefly at the wrong location (if there is no event following the mouse up event in the menu)

	- The layout update phase (run when we are done processing the mouse up in the menu) doesn't position the inspector at all... Another event must occur to run a new layout phase to position the inspector correctly.

- Fix Tag Filter crash when becoming first responder

- Improve Tag Filter Filter to give up the focus on a cancel button click (see the Search field behavior in Mac OS X Finder)

	- Requires a custom EtoileUI control or a NSSearchFieldCell subclass that implements this behavior (there is no delegate API to do so)

- Fix Icon View crash

- Force grid alignment in the Icon View (letting the user positions icons seems useless)

- Finish Search support in History Browser

- Improve History Browser title


Missing Features
----------------

- Improve Inspector

	- Add fields

		- Variations (aka Branches)
		- Cheap Copy checkbox (or something label telling the object is a cheap copy) + a button to show the parent or original Object

	- Support showing additional fields based on the object type
	
		- Image: preview and image size (width and height)
		- Bookmark: URL
		
	- Decide whether we should list attachements and their URLs

- Opening Objects (using UTIs to decide which service we use)

	- Requires some service registry to bind editors/viewers to UTIs
	
	- Implement Open in History Browser (for opening a past version)

- Opening other stores than the default one

	- Add 'Open Other CoreObject Store…' to the Application menu
	
		- Once a CoreObject Store is picked in the Open panel, a new manager window appears
		
	- Needs some badges or hints (perhaps in the titlebar) to indicate which manager windows relate to which stores
	
- New Object From Template…

	- Add a template picker to EtoileUI

- Pick and drop to move objects around

	- Link (default)
	- Copy (option key)
	- Move (command + option key or perhaps just command key)

- Deleted objects smart group and Object Undeletion

- Time-based smart groups (in When section of the source list)

- Import/Export. ObjectManager should support just few basic types at least initially:

	- Bookmark
	- Image
	- ?

- Support opening multiple manager windows

- Fine-grained control over the grid used in the Icon View

- Note Management 

	- Note Library
	
	- Notes can include Lists e.g. Todo or Buy lists.

	- Simple Note View (actived if the Notes library is selected)
	
		- Something similar to Google Keep but a bit smarter and with a better usability

		- Would provide a very basic Outliner to edit lists
		
	- Notes can be opened in a real Outliner (notes are just normal outliner documents) or a Structured Text Editor
	
	- Full-blown Outliner documents can be browsed in the ObjectManager (using the Note View or the List  view)


Future Work
-----------

- Library Management (creation, deletion, export and import)

- Temporal Search against the store 
	
	- For now we just support searching the latest object revisions in memory

- Device Representations e.g. external hard disks

- Filesystem Browsing (as an advanced option) using COFile and CODirectory

- Activity Reporting to track and manage progresses copy, deletion, downloads, etc. in a Unified UI

	- Either in the ObjectManager itself or in a distinct application (e.g. Activity Manager)
	
	- Etoile or CoreObject-based applications can use this UI to report about their background tasks
	
		- Provide a special COObject subclass in CoreObject or EtoileUI to report progresses (e.g. CO(User)Operation). This would let us use the store as persistent distributed notification center. For example, a WebBrowser makes a new commit on a COUserOperation instance each time, the download progresses a bit, and the Activity Reporter automatically gets a store update as a result.

- Use Small Control Sizes in the Inspector (or at least a small font size)


Open Questions
--------------

- For a library, should we present a size that includes the children objects

	- For COGroup/Tag size, we consider that children objects are not really contained and doesn't enter in the size computation (moreover knowing the boundaries for the size computation could be really tricky for nested groups)
